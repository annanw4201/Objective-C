# Notes during doing the projects (needs to update as many notes as possible by reviewing from the begining)

- view controller life cycles: view will load -> view did load -> view will appear -> view will disappear -> view did disappear
- remember always to check if the outlets have been wired up
- table view: need to set up resuable identifier for cells
- table view: properties should be strong, otherwise the properties value will be nil as soon as some one else doesn't retain it
- table view: the cell type should be set properly(like if the cell has subtitle or not), otherwise when seeting some properties of cell, it will not shown when launching the app
- image view: set the frame as the image's original width and height, otherwise, the image will fit into a screen and will be distorted
- image view: set clip to bounds property to let the view can display image on the whole screen when rotating
- scroll view: need to set the image view to be the zooming view
- scroll view: to scale the image, find the minimum scale factor such that widthScale = scrollview.width / image.width and heightScale = scrollview.height / image.height. Then the image will scale using these two scale factor but have to match (scroll.minScale, scroll.maxScale)
- scroll view: need to set minimum and maximum allowed scale, or the scale won't work
- scroll view: set content size as the same size as the image that's going to be scrolled, so that it will cover all the area of image and don't have extra spacing
- scroll view: set the content off set to (0,0) will align the image to the top left corner
- use NSUserDefaults to save data, need to mutuble copy the data, and then manipulate that data, and finally set the new data at a predetermined path.
- To synchronize NSUserDefaults is not cheap, the system will calls for you, it's useful when we suddenly terminate the app from XCode. We will synchronize since our app will not use that many data.
- scrollView, should update the image frame and any ohter settings when rotate
- Ask someone about Autolayouts 
- need to set zoomScale of scrollView before set the content size since zoom scale will affect content size
- read and write to local variable in code block need to use \_\_block prefix
- local variable is strong by default, so when use blcok variable \_\_weak might help avoiding memory cycles which can cause memory leaks
- When to use blocks: Enumeration, view animation, sorting(use code block as comarision method), notification, error handler, completion handler, Multi-threading is the essential reason we use block
- don't call UI methods outside of main queue, when do something related to UI inside a code block, just put those UI methods into main queue block
- inside the code block, when setting properties, remember to use self.property, otherwise may not set
- when setting the properties, check if that property triggers the UI method, if it does, put it inside main thread
- since ios 11.2, there is a bug, the barBUttonItem will not change back to normal state unless set it unable then enable again
- remember to set the delegate first, then do some changes with the delegate
- core Location is an API for getting the device location, it has CLLocation object storing coordinates, altitude; and also CLLocationAccuracy, CLLocationSpeed, CLLocationDirection, timeStam, method of measure distance from another CLLocation.
- use CLLocationManager to get CLLocation. But always fist check if the user allow the app to use location service or not
- mapKit is a framework, it has MKMapView, MKAnnotationView which has title, subtitle, left and right accessory views(need to set canShowCallout to YES).
- set region of MKMapView will zoom and scale to that region(MKCoordinateRegion)
- MKMapPoint MKMapRect can be convert to/back from CGPoint, CGRect
