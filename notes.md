# Notes during doing the projects (needs to update as many notes as possible by reviewing from the begining)
- remember always to check if the outlets have been wired up
- table view: need to set up resuable identifier for cells
- table view: properties should be strong, otherwise the properties value will be nil as soon as some one else doesn't retain it
